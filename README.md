# Automated Insights Generation

## 📌 Motivation

In today's data-driven world, extracting meaningful insights from vast datasets is crucial for informed decision-making. However, complex querying languages and coding requirements create barriers for many users. This project aims to **democratize data analysis** by allowing users to generate insights from their data using **natural language inputs**, delivering high-quality **visual and textual insights** without requiring technical expertise.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Accept **natural language** input and generate insights without writing SQL or code.
* Build a **data pipeline** to load CSV files into an SQL database and connect via **LangChain**.
* Develop a **chat-based application** to interactively generate insights using **LangChain** and **Streamlit**.

---

## 💼 Relevance to Roles

* **PMs**: Get quick, data-driven insights without technical overhead.
* **TPMs**: Identify bottlenecks and optimize GenAI project workflows.
* **SDEs**: Integrate LLM components for NLP-driven analytics.
* **Engineering Managers**: Guide teams with data-backed decisions.
* **DevOps Engineers**: Maintain scalable, reliable deployments.
